# Add your repo!

Repos can come from openpharma, and if added there they automatically pop up 
in the site. 

To prevent an openpharma repo from appearing - add them to here under 
`openpharma_exclude:`: [openpharma_included.yaml](https://github.com/openpharma/openpharma.github.io/blob/master/openpharma_included.yaml)

To add repo that is not in the github.com/openpharma org, you can do so by adding it 
here `repos:`: [openpharma_included.yaml](https://github.com/openpharma/openpharma.github.io/blob/master/openpharma_included.yaml)

Optionally, you can add metadata as well at the bottom of the yaml.

# Notes

See gh-actions for build.

Should migrate to CHOASS stack? See experiment folder.
